# Periodic Table of Elements
 My first project. A periodic table of elements.

## Why I Began this Project
A Twitter follower recommended I integrate what I've learned into projects on occasion. Up until this point I had only followed along with tutorials, completed school projects and created a color flipper without guidance.

## What I've Learned

### CSS Grid
While making the periodic table of elements, I found it most practical to deploy a grid layout using CSS. The grid layout has 18 columns and 11 rows. Particular buttons has to be placed in specific grid locations. Using the shorthand grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns I was able to achieve this.
